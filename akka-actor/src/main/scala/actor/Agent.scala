/**
* The Agent class was strongly inspired by the agent principle in Clojure.
* <p/>
*
* Agents provide independent, asynchronous change of individual locations.
* Agents are bound to a single storage location for their lifetime, and
* only allow mutation of that location (to a new state) to occur as a
* result of an action. Actions are functions (with, optionally, additional
* arguments) that are asynchronously applied to an Agent's state and whose
* return value becomes the Agent's new state. Because the set of functions
* is open, the set of actions supported by an Agent is also open, a sharp
* contrast to pattern matching message handling loops provided by Actors.
* <p/>
*
* Agents are reactive, not autonomous - there is no imperative message loop
* and no blocking receive. The state of an Agent should be itself immutable
* (preferably an instance of one of Akka's persistent collections), and the
* state of an Agent is always immediately available for reading by any
* thread (using the '()' function) without any messages, i.e. observation
* does not require cooperation or coordination.
* <p/>
*
* The actions of all Agents get interleaved amongst threads in a thread pool.
* At any point in time, at most one action for each Agent is being executed.
* Actions dispatched to an agent from another single agent or thread will
* occur in the order they were sent, potentially interleaved with actions
* dispatched to the same agent from other sources.
* <p/>
*
* If an Agent is used within an enclosing transaction, then it will
* participate in that transaction.
* <p/>
*
* Example of usage:
* <pre>
* val agent = Agent(5)
*
* agent send (_ + 1)
* agent send (_ * 2)
*
* val result = agent()
* ... // use result
*
* agent.close
* </pre>
* <p/>
*
* Agent is also monadic, which means that you can compose operations using
* for-comprehensions. In monadic usage the original agents are not touched
* but new agents are created. So the old values (agents) are still available
* as-is. They are so-called 'persistent'.
* <p/>
*
* Example of monadic usage:
* <pre>
* val agent1 = Agent(3)
* val agent2 = Agent(5)
*
* for (value <- agent1) {
*   result = value + 1
* }
*
* val agent3 =
*   for (value <- agent1) yield value + 1
*
* val agent4 = for {
*   value1 <- agent1
*   value2 <- agent2
* } yield value1 + value2
*
* agent1.close
* agent2.close
* agent3.close
* agent4.close
* </pre>
* <p/>
*
* <b>IMPORTANT</b>:
* <p/>
* You can *not* call 'agent.get', 'agent()' or use the monadic 'foreach',
* 'map' and 'flatMap' within an enclosing transaction since that would block
* the transaction indefinitely. But all other operations are fine. The system
* will raise an error (e.g. *not* deadlock) if you try to do so, so as long as
* you test your application thoroughly you should be fine.
